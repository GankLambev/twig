## Why did we create that?

While working on some of our products at [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com) (like [devo.ps](http://devo.ps) or [SweepBoard](http://sweepboard.com)), we wanted to have a simple, consistent and clean lineart icon set available in several sizes so that the thickness of the icons remained the same at various font sizes.

We couldn't find anything that worked for us without a significant investment of time or money, or both. Also, we like drawing icons. So we built *twig*.

We released it under an [MIT license](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/twig/blob/master/LICENSE.md) so feel free to [go over GitHub](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/twig) and contribute to it.
